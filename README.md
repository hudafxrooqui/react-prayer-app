Muslim Prayer App React.Js Project

I used React.Js to produce a Prayer App for my laptop that showed the prayer times ( Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib and Isha) based on what city was selected. The website sends window alerts via Javascript to the user when it is prayer time. I used a city API and a prayer API to fetch data. The prayer app displays every week when it is Jummah time on Fridays.

To add more to this project, I would like to include a search bar that can locate different mosques and their information based on the users location and how close they are.
Below is a screenshot of the current UI design. Currently, I am working on fetching prayer data and displaying it on the user interface.
